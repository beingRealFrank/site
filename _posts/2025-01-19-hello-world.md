Hey folks. I’m starting a new website. I’ve done this many times, but this time feels different. This site is my attempt to break away from social media and create something more personal, meaningful, and future-proof. Here’s why.

## Reason One: Moving Away from Social Media
I’ve decided to pause—or perhaps outright discontinue—creating content for social media platforms. Over time, I’ve grown to dislike what platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become: cesspools of negativity and corporate overreach. Mark Zuckerberg’s recent decisions, including his monetary and policy support of Donald Trump, have solidified my decision to stop feeding these platforms my content. The fact that tomorrow is Inauguration Day for Trump’s second term makes this feel a bit more poetic. 

While I’ll still keep Facebook for rare occasions—like staying in touch with my mother or finding local events—I won’t post new updates there. From now on, this site will be the home for my content.

## Reason Two: A Professional Reinvention
I’m approaching the one-year mark of a significant shift in my career. After leaving Comcast and joining Bloomberg, I transitioned out of leadership roles to return to my roots in software development. With Bloomberg’s support, I’ve spent the past year writing code again—primarily in Python and Go, focused on data engineering. This change has brought me more joy and fulfillment in my work than I’ve felt in decades.

This renewed passion for coding has extended into my personal projects. I’ve been diving into blockchain technology and building tools to analyze cryptocurrency markets. As I learn and experiment, I plan to share useful insights and tools here.

## Reason Three: The Internet is Changing
I believe we’re witnessing a major evolution in how we use the internet. Technologies like Web3, generative AI, and federated social media are reshaping how we interact and create. Social media companies are making moves to adapt, but I see an opportunity to step outside their ecosystem and explore alternatives.

This site is my experiment. Maybe it’ll seem like one of Frank’s crazy ideas, but I see it as a detour. The future is uncertain, but I’m betting it will look very different from today. Who knows? Perhaps we’ll all host our own content someday, merging it in ways we can’t yet imagine.

I hope you’ll join me on this journey. Bookmark this page and check back for updates. Let’s explore what the future holds—together.
