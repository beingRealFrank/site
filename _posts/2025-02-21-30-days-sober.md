I am, as of today, 30 days sober. I decided last month to quit intoxicants entirely. It wasn't the result of a negative event or a spiral into truly dark territory, but it was a necessity. 

I have an addictive personality and need to be careful. I've gotten myself addicted to exercise, alcohol, and a number of other "process addictions" over the years. I've always been pretty functional but I also have a lot of privilege propping me up. 

I've taken to the Recovery Dharma program. I'm a fan of Secular Buddhism and this material dovetails perfectly with that philosophy. 

If you have any questions or need help yourself, don't be shy. I'm not.
