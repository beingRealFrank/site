Hey folks,

I’m starting a new website. I’ve done this many times, but this time feels different. This site is my attempt to break away from social media and create something more personal, meaningful, and future-proof. Here’s why.

## Reason One: Moving Away from Social Media
I’ve decided to pause—or perhaps outright discontinue—creating content for social media platforms. Over time, I’ve grown to dislike what platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become: cesspools of negativity and corporate overreach. Mark Zuckerberg’s recent decisions, including his open support of Donald Trump’s policies and campaign, have cemented my decision to stop feeding these platforms my content.

I won’t delete my accounts—I’ll still lurk occasionally to stay in touch with my mother or find local events. But if you want updates from me, you’ll need to visit this site.

## Reason Two: A Professional Reinvention
This month marks one year since I reinvented my career. After leaving Comcast and joining Bloomberg, I shifted out of leadership roles to return to my roots in software development. With Bloomberg’s support, I’ve spent the last year writing code again, primarily in Python and Go, focused on data engineering. It’s been the most fulfilling work I’ve done in decades.

This return to coding has reignited my passion for technical projects. At home, I’ve been diving into blockchain technology and developing tools to analyze cryptocurrency markets. As I learn and build, I plan to share useful insights and tools here.

## Reason Three: The Internet is Changing
I believe we’re witnessing a major evolution in how we use the internet. Technologies like Web3, generative AI, and federated social media are reshaping how we interact and create. Social media companies are making moves to adapt, but I see an opportunity to step outside their ecosystem and explore alternatives.

This site is my experiment. Maybe it’ll seem like one of Frank’s crazy ideas, but I see it as a detour. The future is uncertain, but I’m betting it will look very different from today. Who knows? Perhaps we’ll all host our own content someday, merging it in ways we can’t yet imagine.

I hope you’ll join me on this journey. Bookmark this page and check back for updates. Let’s explore what the future holds—together.
