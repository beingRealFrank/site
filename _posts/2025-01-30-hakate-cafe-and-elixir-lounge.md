Last night, a friend and I went to Hekate, NYC’s sober bar, for a night of mocktails and drag bingo. It wasn’t my first time there, but it was my first time really leaning into the experience—and I’m glad I did.

I had this tiki-style mocktail with a mix of NA dark rums, coconut water, lime, and just enough cayenne to give it a little kick. Easily one of the best non-alcoholic drinks I’ve had—rich, smooth, and surprisingly complex. I'm kinda liking the idea of making more of these layered flavorful drinks at home. 

Drag bingo, as always, delivered. We didn’t win, but that was never really the point. Between the drinks, the crowd, and the overall energy, it was one of those nights that makes me want to explore more of the city

Definitely won’t be my last time there.

I've started a page where I'm going to keep track of places like this. Check it out.
