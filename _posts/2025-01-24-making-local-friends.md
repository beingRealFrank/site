title: "Making Local Friends"
---

I've been thinking quite a bit latley about doing more to make friends around the homefront. I use to have this narrative that it was hard for me to make friends because my interests are a little niche. I've decided that's pretty dumb in this day and age. The internet means any two people with arguably wacky hobbies can find each other. 

I've been seriously into two things lately. Investing and coding. My current personal projects combine the two activities and revolve around cryptocurrency data analytics. I realize this may seem a little bro-y, maybe even tech-bro-y, but I promise I'm not domineering or annoying about it. Since leaning back into coding at work, I'm just really loving the return to all things tech. 

If you have interest or know anyone who does, please reach out. I'll leave my email here, just in case. 

Thanks!
