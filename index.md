Hi there. Welcome to my site, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Frank. I've considered myself a professional Computer Geek for most of my life, but also like to write. 

I've organized this site into two broad categories: personal posts, aka [blather](/blather/), and [useful posts](/useful/).

I am obsessed with Pokémon Go. Feel free to take a gander at my [Pokémon Go Resource Page](/pokemon-go/).
