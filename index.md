Hi there. Welcome to my site, and thanks for stopping by. My name is Frank. I'm a professional Computer Geek and Data Engineer by trade, but also like to write, keep moving, and play games. 

I've organized this site into two broad categories: personal posts, aka [blather](/blather/), and [useful posts](/useful/).

I am specifically obsessed with Pokémon Go. Take a gander at my [Pokémon Go Resources page](/pokemon-go/) and let me know if you have any questions I can help with.
