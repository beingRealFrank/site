# Introduction
I've been playing Pokémon Go since 2016.  I've learned a number of things about the game that aren't obvious to new players.  I thought I'd begin to collect tips, tricks, and desciptions of these more advanced game play lessons.

# Tips and Tricks
New Pokémon trainers are walked through a number of research tasks that introduce them to basic game play.  You're walked through how to catch pokémon, how to throw curve balls etc., but you're not shown many of the features below. Some of these things came about secretly as methods of testing the app, others were bugs that players came to love and have remained.

## * Quick Catching
Quick catching is a method for skipping the animations/screens that appear after you catch a pokémon. This makes catching several pokémon in a row a lot faster and is useful for things like Community Days.  This is a [video detailing the quick catch method](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SaCujhnbJj0).  It takes practice, but is totally worth it.

## * The Circle Lock
The two cirlces targeting a pokémon with a pokéball indicate where you have to aim for catching it.  The inner cicle measures how close to the center of the outer circle you are and rates your throw as "Nice! Great! or Excellent!".  Pokémon Go at its core is a game of statistics and random number generation. Excellent throws give you a higher liklihood of catching the mon.  This is espeically important when encountering a Legendary pokémon, generally considered more valuable/useful. You're unlikely to catch one of these if you can't land several Excellent throws.  

Circle Locking, is a technique for freezing the oscialing inner target circle in a location that ensures you achieve the throw rating you want. This [video demostrates the circle locking technique](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mFxdTlG2-Vo).
