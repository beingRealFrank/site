# Introduction
I've been playing Pokémon Go since 2016.  I've learned a number of things about the game that aren't obvious to new players.  I thought I'd begin to collect tips, tricks, and desciptions of these more advanced game play lessons.

# Tips and Tricks
New Pokémon trainers are walked through a number of research tasks that introduce them to basic game play.  You're walked through how to catch pokémon, how to throw curve balls etc., but you're not shown many of the features below. Some of these things came about secretly as methods of testing the app, others were bugs that players came to love and have remained.

## Quick Catching
Quick catching is a method for skipping the animations/screens that appear after you catch a pokémon. This makes catching several pokémon in a row a lot faster and is useful for things like Community Days.  This is a [video detailing the quick catch method](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SaCujhnbJj0).  It takes practice, but is totally worth it.
